# modified by Eric O'Connell to use TextMate::UI.request_item
#
# a proof-of-concept to bring FuzzyFileFinder (http://github.com/jamis/fuzzy_file_finder/tree/master)
# back to textmate. FuzzyFileFinder is a (somewhat improved) implementation of TextMate's "cmd-T"
# functionality written by Jamis Buck. This bundle however isn't quite as useful as TextMate's "cmd-T"
# as it is not integrated enough with TextMate. I'm hoping that somebody will be interested in
# rewriting this to work with Dialog2.
